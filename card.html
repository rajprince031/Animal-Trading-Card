            <p class='DescriptionPara'>Tigers are the largest species of the cat family and are known for their
                distinctive orange coat with black stripes. Found primarily in Asia, they are apex predators, primarily
                hunting large ungulates. Tigers are solitary animals, often marking their territory with scent markings
                and vocalizations.</p>
